# Barcoded aptamers analysis pipeline
## This pipeline is nearly identical to the DADA2 pipeline published at https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/ using forward reads only
## Repro analysis shown mainly for filter and trimming steps. Output from this analysis is a .csv file with inferred sequences (columns) and sample names (rows). Formulations were mapped to inferred sequences using barcodes and transformed in Excel per _Materials and Methods_.
